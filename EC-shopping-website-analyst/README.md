- This section originally focused on traditional e-commerce data analysis, brick-and-mortar retail data analysis, as well as cross-border e-commerce product selection and marketing strategies.
- I'm considering switching to video links instead. After all, they can't take down my YouTube videos.
- My old five-year account contained extensive real-world business code. But since it was suspended, and because my computer has been mysteriously flagged, uploading and pulling code has become difficult.
- According to GitHub's policy, if I don't receive any response to my appeal within 90 days, my old account will be deleted. At that point, the IP address from my computer might be unblocked. For now, it's nearly impossible for me to rebuild everything I had before in a short timeframe.
- I don't plan to buy a new computer. Since both my account and IP were blocked without explanation, I don't want to waste my efforts. I'm worried about putting in all that work only to mysteriously lose access to a new account again.
